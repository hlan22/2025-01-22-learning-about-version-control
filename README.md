# Learning about Version Control

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

One thing that I like most about version control is that it gives you the ability to undo your mistakes very easily. There are a lot of checks and balances in place to make sure you can go back to a previous version of the file where your code was working, etc.

One thing I find challenging about version control is the inability to work on a file at the exact same time, and the amount of time it can take to resolve complex merge conflicts problems.
